# React/Redux Workshop

This workshop covers the basics of React and how to add Redux and ImmutableJs into your build so that you can have predicatable state containers to your application.

* [React Slides](https://slides.com/joekarlsson/reactjs/)
* [Redux Slides](https://slides.com/joekarlsson/redux/)

## Getting Started

Download and unpack [React/Redux Demo Workshop](https://github.com/JoeKarlsson/react-redux-workshop). Or alternatively checkout from source:

    git clone https://github.com/JoeKarlsson/react-redux-workshop.git
    cd react-redux-workshop

Next, inside the project, you need to install the project's various NPM dependencies:

    npm install

You should now be ready to spin up a development build this project:

    npm start

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
