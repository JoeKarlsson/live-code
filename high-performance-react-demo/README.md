# Building High Performance React Applications Demo Project

React is built with performance in mind. But when is React slow? In this talk weâ€™ll discuss common bottlenecks in React and when you might be making your program work harder than it should.

Slides: [Building High Performance React Applications](https://speakerdeck.com/joekarlsson/building-high-performance-react-applications)

## Getting Started

Download and unpack [High Performance React Applications](https://github.com/JoeKarlsson/high-performance-react-demo). Or alternatively checkout from source:

    git clone https://github.com/JoeKarlsson/high-performance-react-demo.git
    cd high-performance-react-demo

Next, inside the project, you need to install the project's various NPM dependencies:

    npm install

You should now be ready to spin up a development build this project:

    npm start

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
